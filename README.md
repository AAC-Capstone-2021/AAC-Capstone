"# AAC-Capstone" 

"AAC-Capstone is our capstone project that provides a web application for the Academic Assessment Committee at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.

Currently, the AAC has a member of different degree programs at UNO fill out an assessment of their respective program once every year or couple of years.  They fill this report out on a word document and send it back and forth between the AAC and the faculty member.  This process is tiresome and lengthy.

This web application will make filling out the form more accessible and a smoother process in general.  As a faculty member, they can log in and then access their forms from the past or fill out their form this year if one is required of them.  While filling the form, they will go step by step through the different major sections (SLOs, Assessments, Subassessments, and Analysis).  They are allowed to import old SLOs and old Assessments to make the process faster.  At the end, they can view their work and also see past forms.

As an AAC member, you can look at all of the departments past reports and also grade the completed reports that have been completed this year.  The member logs in and is taken to the home page where they can begin assessing the different forms or go to the archive and search for old forms."
